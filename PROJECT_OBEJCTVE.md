#### Objective of Project:
The Core of the project will be the Backend, however we need a working Frontend
1. Frontend:
   2. Attaches to background (this Project will be hosted in AWS). 
      3. You look spot on so far
   4. Always be thinking about this, "how can I cleanly nest as much information as i can about the active task. live updates"
   5. A manager of agents and tasks and active prompts (Needs designed but planning to use a 'customer prompt_generator Agent') 
2. Backend:
   3. There will be a Top Level Agents (Enterprise, Orchestration, etc.)
   4. There will be Specialist Agents (Researcher, Compliance, Audit, Forensics)
      5. Each of these will be Graph architectures such as reflection, reflexion, rag, etc.
   5. They will all have Names, Favorite Color, etc. Just like people (e.g, 'bob' nickname)
   6. Agents will need to be able to communcate together (started) and share in memories that will be accessed as needed by other agents
   7. Agents will eventually be outputting artifacts such as .docx, .xlsx, .pdf, .rtf, .zip, etc.
      8.These will need to be accessible from the Completed Task Tile (maybe a mouseover of view in window...)
   8. Backend can RUN without the frontend
